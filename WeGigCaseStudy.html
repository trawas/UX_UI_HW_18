            <div class="summaryContent">
                <p><b>Summary:</b> As  a conceptual case study, design ideas derived from the user research conducted. One of our team members, a musician, mentioned challenges finding new venues to play, and our team decided to focus on that problem. We first conducted a survey of  musicians to determine their current approaches to getting gigs. We spoke 1-on-1 with both musicians and venue operators  in order to understand key challenges to current booking processes. Finally, we conducted a competitive analysis of music-booking apps and websites in order to see what was currently being done well and where the greatest opportunities for improvement resided.</p>
                <p>Survey results found that most of our respondents played frequently, found gigs through word of mouth or established relationships, and that pay was the most important factor in taking a gig. This information informed our approach to creating an app that would meet musicians' needs to find reliable new gigs.</p>

            <p>We first wanted to understand how musicians were currently finding gigs and what elements of finding gigs were most frustrating, so we used SurveyMonkey to develop a brief survey. We posted the survey on several Facebook groups geared toward musicians, as well as sharing it among our personal networks. Answers helped inform our user personas and the questions we asked musicians and venue operators in 1-to-1 interviews.</p>

            <p>We developed two user personas based on our findings from 1-on-1 interviews and surveys, with one persona belonging to a time-starved venue operator who needs to be able to find good musical acts quickly, and one belonging to an up-and-coming musician who needs to find new venues in pursuit of building audiences and hopefully being able to one day play music full-time. We also developed a user insight for each persona.</p>

            <p><b>Summary:</b> Moving on the to the ideation process, we used an “I like, I wish, What if” matrix to brainstorm as a group possible solutions to both Lynne and Travis’s primary concerns. Using a Feature Prioritization matrix to narrow our focus, we decided to focus on offering a quick and reliable onboarding process, with the ability for venues to load details of their stage areas and for musicians to offer clips of their music, as well as the ability for venue operators and musicians to rate each other following a gig in order to promote accountability in payment and professionalism. Finally, we created a User Journey Map for Lynne and Travis in order to describe how use of the WeGig app would make booking musical gigs easier.</p>

        <p>In this project, we learned the power of thinking through multiple sets of user needs and accounting for them through the research process and into design and development. We also developed good rapport by bringing together our differing skillsets and perspectives in order to craft a prototype that met our objectives and that everyone felt good about. We used a mixture of Zoom-based work sessions, Trello, and Slack to keep everyone in the loop and resolve questions as they arose.</p>

            <p>With more time, we would have liked to develop the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Post-gig questionnaire and reliability rating system</li>
                <li>Ability for contract agreements using the WeGig app</li>
                <li>Ability for payment through the WeGig app</li>
                <li>Option for musicians to search for other musicians</li>
