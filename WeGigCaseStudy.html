                <p><b>Summary:</b> As  a conceptual case study, design ideas derived from the user research conducted. One of our team members, a musician, mentioned challenges finding new venues to play, and our team decided to focus on that problem. We first conducted a survey of  musicians to determine their current approaches to getting gigs. We spoke 1-on-1 with both musicians and venue operators  in order to understand key challenges to current booking processes. Finally, we conducted a competitive analysis of music-booking apps and websites in order to see what was currently being done well and where the greatest opportunities for improvement resided.</p>

        <div id="surveyResultsText">
            <p>We first wanted to understand how musicians were currently finding gigs and what elements of finding gigs were most frustrating, so we used SurveyMonkey to develop a brief survey and posted it on several Facebook groups geared toward musicians, as well as sharing it among our personal networks. Answers helped inform our user personas and the questions we asked musicians and venue operators in 1-to-1 interviews.</p>

            <p>Competitive analysis looked at four direct competitors and three indirect competitors.

        <div class="userPersonasText">
            <p>We developed two user personas based on our findings from 1-on-1 interviews and surveys, with one persona belonging to a time-starved venue operator who needs to be able to find good musical acts quickly, and one belonging to an up-and-coming musician who needs to find new venues in pursuit of building audiences and hopefully being able to one day play music full-time. We also developed a user insight for each persona.</p>

            <p><b>Summary:</b> Moving on the to the ideation process, we used an “I like, I wish, What if” matrix to brainstorm as a group possible solutions to both Lynne and Travis’s primary concerns. Using a Feature Prioritization matrix to narrow our focus, we decided to focus on offering a quick and reliable onboarding process, with the ability for venues to load details of their stage areas and for musicians to offer clips of their music, as well as the ability for venue operators and musicians to rate each other following a gig in order to promote accountability in payment and professionalism. Finally, we created a User Journey Mao for Lynne and Travis in order to describe how use of the WeGig app would make booking musical gigs easier.</p>

        <p><b>Summary:</b> We conducted usability tests with 6 users and 6 tasks. 3 tasks focused on using the app as a venue operator, and 3 tasks focsed on use as a musician. None of the testers had difficulty creating profiles, but several testers ran into difficulty completing the booking process and leaving reviews. </p>

            <p>Using a Feedback Prioritization matrix, we analyzed our testing results in order to decide what to work on first. We needed to ensure that the booking process was simple to understand and complete, and that leaving reviews was also easy to do.  We also found opportunities to further simplify the profile creation process.</p>
