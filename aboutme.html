                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I have worked with people of all ages, observing and asking questions, for as long as I can remember. As a child, I wrote endless stories, honing my observational skills. As a teacher and public services librarian, I needed to understand the perspectives people were coming from in order to provide tools to help them reach their goals. My first addictive taste of the power of UX research came while observing students interacting with a database. These experiences have shaped my approach and my underlying belief that designing for people where they are leads to growth for everyone. </p>

                <h1>How I Work</h1>
                <p>I work like a Swiss Army knife: pick the right tools for the job. Collaboration is key; I love to work with teams that want to be part of the user research process. And I’m compelled to keep user insights at the forefront of the design process that follows, so that what’s created can address the needs identified by the people we learned from.</p>
